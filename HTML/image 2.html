    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The presiding image of Kedarnath in the form of lingam is of irregular shape with a pedestal 3.6 m (12 ft) in
        circumference and 3.6 m (12 ft) in height. There is a small pillared hall in front of the temple, that has
        images of Parvati and of the five Pandava princes. There are four temples around Kedarnath itself, namely-
        Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar, and Kalpeshwar which form the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites.[17] The first
        hall inside Kedarnath Temple contains statues of the five Pandava brothers, Krishna, Nandi, the vehicle of Shiva
        and Virabhadra, one of the guards of Shiva. Statues of Draupadi and other deities are also installed in the main
        hall.[1] An unusual feature of the temple is the head of a man carved in the triangular stone lingam. Such a
        head is seen carved in another temple nearby constructed on the site where the marriage of Shiva and Parvati was
        held. Adi Shankara was believed to have revived this temple, along with Badrinath and other temples of
        Uttarakhand; he is believed to have attained Mahasamadhi at Kedarnath. Behind the temple is the samƒÅdhi mandir
        of Adi Sankara.[18]

        The head priest (Raval) of the Kedarnath temple belongs to the Veerashaiva community from Karnataka.[19]
        However, unlike in Badrinath temple, the Raval of Kedarnath temple does not perform the pujas. The pujas are
        carried out by Raval's assistants on his instructions. The Raval moves with the deity to Ukhimath during the
        winter season. There are five main priests for the temple, and they become head priests for one year by
        rotation. The present (2013) Raval of Kedarnath temple is Shri Vageesha Lingacharya from Davanagere district,
        Karnataka.[19] Surrounding Kedarnath, there are many symbols of the Pandavas. Raja Pandu died at Pandukeshwar.
        The tribals here perform a dance called "Pandav Lila".[20] The mountain top where the Pandavas went to Swarga,
        is known as "Swargarohini", which is located off Badrinath. When Yudhishtira, the eldest of the Pandavas, was
        leaving for the heaven, one of his fingers fell on the earth. At that place, Yudhishtira installed a Shiva
        Linga, which is the size of the thumb. To gain Mashisharupa, Lord Shiva and Bheema fought with maces. Bheema was
        struck with remorse. He started to massage Shiva's body with ghee. In memory of this event, even today, this
        triangular Shiva lingam is massaged with ghee. Water and bilva-patra leaves are used for worship.
